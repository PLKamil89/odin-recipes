    <p>Kharcho is a hearty <strong>beef soup in tomato broth</strong> 
    with a wonderful blend of spices and plenty of fresh herbs.</strong> 
    </p> 
    <p> The beef is <strong>fall-apart tender</strong> and just melts in the mouth,
    which is why the recipe has been adopted and loved by many Georgian families and Easter Europeans alike.
