    <p>This soft, cheese-filled bread is <strong>the national dish of Georgia.</strong> 
       Part of its charm is that it varies by region.</p> 
     <p> The open-faced <strong>Adjaruli</strong> version is filled with cheese and herbs, 
       and garnished with an egg on top. </p></center>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>3 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
         <li>1 cup of milk</li>
         <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons of granulated sugar</li>
         <li>1/2 teaspoon of coriander</li>
         <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons of salt</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons of instant dry yeast</li>
         <li>2 & 3/4 cups of flour</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>To make the dough: Heat the butter and milk together in a small saucepan until the butter melts.</li>
        <li>Place the sugar, coriander, and salt in a large bowl, and pour the hot milk over it, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cool to lukewarm.</li>
        <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup. Stir in the yeast and flour, mixing until a shaggy mass forms. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the rest, knead until smooth; 8 to 10 minutes by hand, or 6 to 8 minutes at medium speed in a mixer. Knead in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons flour if the dough is sticky.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until it increases in size by at least one third.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Place all the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat to combine, or pulse everything together briefly with a food processor; leave some bits of the cheese intact.</li>
        <li>To assemble: Line two baking sheets with parchment. Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into four equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into an oval shape. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon one quarter of the cheese mixture into the center of each and spread.</li>
        <li>Pull the dough's edges up around the cheese, folding and twisting the ends to form a boat shape.</li>
        <li>Cover and let rise for 20 minutes, or until puffy but not doubled. While the breads are rising, preheat the oven to 190°C with two racks toward the center.</li>
        <li>Brush the exposed edges of the khachapuri with the egg wash and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until they feel set.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the filling of each khachapuri. Crack an egg into each, place a teaspoon of butter on top, and bake for an additional 8 to 10 minutes (for soft-set eggs), or 12 to 15 minutes (for firmer eggs).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and serve warm. Garnish with additional fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>
